BUSINESS CONTEXT: Request Approval Process

This dataset represents our organization's request approval workflow for financial expenditures and procurement requests. The process handles different approval paths based on request amount and customer type:

PROCESS OVERVIEW:
- Standard requests (<$1000): Auto-approval after initial review
- Premium requests ($1000-$10000): Manager approval required
- Enterprise requests (>$10000): Executive approval required

KEY STAKEHOLDERS:
- Sales Department: Initial request submission and review
- Finance Department: Financial validation and approval
- Operations Department: Final processing and fulfillment
- Executive Team: High-value request approval

BUSINESS GOALS:
- Reduce approval cycle time
- Ensure compliance with financial controls
- Improve customer satisfaction through faster processing

CURRENT CHALLENGES:
