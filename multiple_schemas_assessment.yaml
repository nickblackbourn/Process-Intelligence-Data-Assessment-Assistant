transformation_plan:
  overview: Step-by-step plan to transform source data into process mining event log
  steps:
  - step: 1
    title: Data Preparation
    description: Clean and prepare source data files
    actions:
    - Remove duplicate records
    - Handle missing values
    - Standardize data formats
    - Validate data integrity
  - step: 2
    title: Case ID Creation
    description: Create case identifiers from available data
    actions:
    - Analyze data patterns to identify process instances
    - Create composite case IDs if necessary
    - Validate case boundaries
  - step: 5
    title: Event Log Assembly
    description: Combine all elements into final event log
    actions:
    - Merge case IDs, activities, and timestamps
    - Add case and event attributes
    - Validate event log structure
    - Export in standard format (CSV/XES)
  estimated_effort: Medium
  prerequisites: []
next_steps:
- Review and validate the recommended case ID, activity, and timestamp mappings
- Prepare data transformation scripts based on the transformation plan
- Test the event log creation process with a sample of data
- Validate the resulting event log with process mining tools
- Iterate and refine the mapping based on initial results
