business_context: 'Business Process Context: E-commerce Order Fulfillment


  PROCESS OVERVIEW:

  This data represents the order fulfillment process for an e-commerce company. The
  process starts when a customer places an order and ends when the order is delivered
  to the customer.


  PROCESS STEPS:

  1. Order Created - Customer places an order on the website

  2. Payment Processing - Payment is processed (may fail and require retry)

  3. Order Packing - Warehouse staff picks and packs the items

  4. Quality Check - Optional quality control for high-value items

  5. Order Shipping - Package is handed over to shipping carrier

  6. Order Delivery - Package is delivered to customer (may fail and require retry)


  BUSINESS OBJECTIVES:

  - Reduce order fulfillment time from order creation to delivery

  - Minimize payment failures and abandoned orders

  - Identify bottlenecks in the warehouse and shipping processes

  - Improve delivery success rates

  - Analyze process variations for different order values and customer types


  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:

  - Order-to-delivery cycle time

  - Payment success rate

  - Warehouse processing time

  - Shipping carrier performance

  - First-time delivery success rate


  PROCESS VARIANTS:

  - High-value orders (>$200) require quality checks

  - Failed payments trigger retry processes

  - Failed deliveries trigger redelivery attempts

  - Different shipping methods for different regions


  DATA SOURCES:

  - Order management system (order creation, status updates)

  - Payment processing system (payment transactions)

  - Warehouse management system (picking, packing activities)

  - Shipping system (tracking information)

  - Customer service system (delivery confirmations, issues)


  ANALYSIS GOALS:

  We want to create an event log that will help us:

  1. Identify the most common process paths

  2. Find bottlenecks and delays in the process

  3. Compare performance across different order types

  4. Analyze the impact of failed payments and deliveries

  5. Optimize warehouse and shipping operations
